<h2><center> Ward's algorithm </center></h2>
 
As creating HDR images requires taking pictures with various exposures, one possible issue that can arise is some movement in the camera between photos.  This would cause some of the pixels in the images to be misaligned and can possibly harm the HDR results.  Therefore, author Greg Ward (Ward, 2003) proposed a solution to this problem by describing a method that can be used to align images for better HDR results.  The method involves creating bitmaps of the images to be aligned, filtering them down by factors of two (as shown below), and then greedily searching for the alignment that minimizes the difference between images.

In addition to implementing Ward’s standard method, we also improved upon his method by putting the images through an edge filter before running the algorithm.  In order to test Ward’s algorithm, we used our same HDR image set that contains 3 images but shifted the images by varying amounts.  Examples of images with descriptions are shown below.
 
 
     	1 image of Wards without filter and 1 image of Ward’s with filter…include description on how the images were misaligned as we used 3 images for HDR and moved 1 image 10 pixels to the left, and another 10 pixels to the right…can also be drastic and put 40 to the left and 40 to the right…1 image without wards at all
 
In comparing the two versions of Ward’s algorithm (with and without an edge filter), we found that Ward’s algorithm performed much better when using an edge filter beforehand.  Two main parameters in the Ward’s algorithm are the maximum amount of bits that you allow the images to be shifted, as well as the noise tolerance.  In particular, without using an edge filter, the algorithm was much more likely to produce extremely large (and faulty) image shifts as we increased either/both parameter values.  We found that using an edge filter improved results for all conditions.  Also, as we can see above, WITHOUT USING WARDS ALGORITHM HOPEFULLY IS WORSE QUALITY THAN WITH EDGE FILTER
